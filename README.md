# Chat application

![Releases](https://github.com/FelixSundqvist/chat-application/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)


## Description

This is a chat application that allows users to send messages to each other. The application is built using React and Node.js.

## Commits

This repository is using the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for commit messages. This is to ensure that the commit messages are easy to read and understand.

This is enforced by a pre-commit hook that runs `commitlint` on the commit message.

## Project structure

The frontend folder structure follows the [bulletproof-react](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md) project structure.
